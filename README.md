Redux Controller Pattern

## Status: In Developement
This library is currently in developement and open to suggestions.

## The problem
Redux is wonderful, but writing the boilerplate required to update and retrieve state can be tedious.
The intention of this library is to reduce the boilerplate needed to do all things redux.
There are many libraries that make managing parts of redux easier such as: reselect, normalizr, autodux, redux-fsa.
But there isnt a tool kit out there that brings all these together and make it easy to implement.
That is where Redux Controller comes in. 

## The solution: Redux Controller
A Controller configures and manages a specific slice of the store, actions, reducer and selectors.
